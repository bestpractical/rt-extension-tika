NAME
    rt-extension-tika - adds Apache Tika document conversion for full text
    search

DESCRIPTION
    RT has the option of providing full text search through the features of
    the underlying database, but it can only search attachments that are in
    plain text and html. If your organization uses typical office software,
    it will often be handy to add documents to a ticket in various office
    document formats. This module makes those document attachments
    searchable through the same full text search as the rest of your
    tickets.

    Apache Tika is a project that extracts plain text from various document
    formats for use in search engines. This plugin requires running a
    tika-server process either on the same machine as RT or on another
    machine, to provide the text extraction for the different supported
    document types.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.1.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::Tika');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::Tika));

        or add rt::extension::tika to your existing @Plugins line.

        By default this extension will index text, html, pdf, doc, and docx
        files. You can add additional mime types by adding them to a list:

            Set(@TikaMimeTypes,'application/rtf','application/x-rtf',
                 'application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text',
                 'application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text-master',
                 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document' 
                 'application/msword',
                'application/vnd.ms-excel',
                'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet' 
        
            );

        You will also need to configure the full text search as with typical
        RT:

            Set( %FullTextSearch,
                Enable     => 1,
                Indexed    => 1,
                Table      => 'Attachments',
                Column     => 'ContentIndex',
            );


    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
    Start the tika server
        From the /opt/rt4 directory you can start the server using:

            ./local/plugins/RT-Extension-Tika/sbin/start-tika-server

        Optionally you can run it via java as:

            java -jar /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-Tika/lib/auto/share/dist/RT-Extension-Tika/tika-server.jar

        You can get a list of options (host, port, CORS) by running:

            java -jar /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-Tika/lib/auto/share/dist/RT-Extension-Tika/tika-server.jar -?

        By default the server will listen on localhost:9998

        If you change the default path you will need to set the TikaURL in
        your RT_SiteConfig.pm

            Set($TikaURL, 'http://someotherhost:9998/');

    Add the indexer to a cron job
        In the directory /opt/rt4 you can run the indexer as:

                ./local/plugins/RT-Extension-Tika/sbin/rt-tika-fulltext-indexer

        This indexer replaces the rt-fulltext-indexer. If you are currently
        running that make sure that job first.
